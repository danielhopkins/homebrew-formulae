  def install
    # apple-notes imports notestore.py as a sibling module, so the two must stay
    # in the same directory. bin/apple-notes is a symlink and the script
    # realpath()s itself, so the import still resolves.
    libexec.install "apple-notes", "notestore.py", "notestore.proto"
    bin.install_symlink libexec/"apple-notes"

    bin.install "apple", "apple-contacts", "apple-mail", "apple-messages",
                "apple-calendar", "reminders"

    doc.install "README.md", "CLAUDE.md", "docs"

    zsh_completion.install Dir["completions/_*"]

    # Claude skills. `apple-tools --skills-dir` is not a thing; point users at
    # the install path in caveats and let them symlink what they want.
    (pkgshare/"skills").install Dir["skills/*"]
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Claude skills are installed to:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/apple-tools/skills

      Link them into whichever Claude config dir you use (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
      selects one per session, and a machine may have several profiles):
        mkdir -p "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills"
        ln -sfn #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/apple-tools/skills/* \
                "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills/"

      reminders-cli is superseded by this formula and ships the same `reminders`
      command. If it is still installed, linking will fail until you remove it:

        brew uninstall reminders-cli && brew link apple-tools

      Each tool needs a one-time macOS permission grant, prompted on first run
      from a terminal. Run these once and approve each dialog:

        reminders show-lists       # Reminders access
        apple-calendar calendars   # Calendar access
        apple-contacts list        # Contacts access

        apple-mail draft --help    # Automation access for Mail, for draft/send

      reminders, apple-calendar and apple-contacts hold their own grants rather
      than borrowing the terminal's, so they work from any terminal and appear
      in System Settings under their own names. Upgrading this formula
      occasionally asks for a grant again; that is expected, not a fault.

      apple-notes, apple-mail and apple-messages read Apple's SQLite stores
      directly, which requires Full Disk Access for your terminal app:
      System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access

      For apple-mail that covers search, export and accounts — they read Mail's
      own index and message files, so they are fast and work with Mail.app
      closed. Only draft and send need the Automation grant above. Run
      `apple mail status` to see both.

      apple-messages is read-only and needs nothing beyond that Full Disk
      Access; it reads ~/Library/Messages/chat.db and never drives Messages.app.

      apple-contacts also reads that store for contact notes, which the Contacts
      framework cannot expose without an Apple-granted entitlement.
